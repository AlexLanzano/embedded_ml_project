This directory contains the application and firmware code for the
Arduino Nano BLE Sense 33. This device supports two applications
"ml_app" and "data_collector"

** data_collector
The data collector app sends the touch screen events over to serial to
be read by the data_collector.py script

** ml_app
The ml app waits for the user to draw an "A" or "B" on the capacitive
touch screen. The model will then determine which character was drawn
and output the symbol over serial.

** How to build and flash
First ensure that you have built and installed the model. Directions
for that are in the README in the ~training~ directory.
