* Firmware
This repository contains the firmware and application source code for
the embedded ML project. There are two applications that can be run on
the device. The first is the *data_collector* application which allows
the user to collect touch input data over serial to train the
model. Next is the *ML* application which takes touch input and sends
the inferred ascii character that was drawn over a serial interface.

** Directory Structure
~applications/~ Contains the application code that gets executed from kernel space.

~common/~       Contains code that both application space and kernel space use.

~kernel/~       Contains kernel code that handles initializing the MCU, initializing the various
                tasks, and initializing/starting the task manager.

~libraries/~    Contains code that is utilized within various application code
