* custom_board
This directory contains the firmware and application code for my
custom ARM board. Right now, my custom board only supports running the
data_collector application which simply sends the touch events over
serial to the data_collector.py script

** Directory Structure
~applications/~ Contains the application code that gets executed from kernel space.

~common/~       Contains code that both application space and kernel space use.

~kernel/~       Contains kernel code that handles initializing the MCU, initializing the various
                tasks, and initializing/starting the task manager.

~libraries/~    Contains code that is utilized within various application code

~SeamOS/~       Contains the RTOS libraries and drivers used for this project
