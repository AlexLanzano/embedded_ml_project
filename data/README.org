* Data
These are a collection of scripts used to process the raw data from
the device into a format the model can train on. Currently, the data
is stored in the data.zip file.

*** data_collector.py
This script listens on a serial device for the touch events reported
and sent over serial by the device. The data is then labeled and
stored in a specified JSON file.

*** data_converter.py
This script takes the point data (stored in the JSON file created by
data_collector.py) and plots it on a 30x30 array that represents the
framebuffer, then stores that in a JSON file. The capacitive touch
screen is 240x240 display but in order to reduce the model size the
points are translated to a 30x30 plane.

*** data_combiner.py
This script simply takes two data files and combines them into one
file.

*** data_view.py
This script allows you to inspect the data by presenting the
framebuffer graphically.
