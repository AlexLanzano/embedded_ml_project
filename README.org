* Embedded ML Project
This repository contains the code for my Embedded ML Project. In this
project I plan to utilize the TensorFlow Lite framework to train and
deploy a ML model to run on an embedded device.

** Project Definition
I plan on training and deploying a model that will detect if a
specific wake-word is spoken. If so, it will turn on a LED.

** Project Milestones
- [ ] Get a TinyML arduino example running on my BLE Sense board
- [ ] Create a simple model and delpoy it to development board
- [ ] Collect or find dataset to train model
- [ ] Train model using Tensorflow
- [ ] Write firmware for the development board to execute the model
  based on input data from microphone peripheral
