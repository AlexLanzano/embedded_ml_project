* Embedded ML Project
This repository contains the code for my Embedded ML Project. In this
project I plan to utilize the TensorFlow Lite framework to train and
deploy a ML model to run on an embedded device. This model will infer
what ascii character the user has drawn on a small capacitive touch
screen and output that character over serial.

** Directory Structure
~data/~      Contains code for data collection

~firmware/~  Contains code that will run directly on the device

~training/~  Contains code that trains the model

** Project Milestones
- [ ] Get a TinyML arduino example running on my BLE Sense board
- [ ] Create a simple model and delpoy it to development board
- [ ] Collect or find dataset to train model
- [ ] Train model using Tensorflow
- [ ] Write firmware for the development board to execute the model
  based on input data from capacitive touch screen
